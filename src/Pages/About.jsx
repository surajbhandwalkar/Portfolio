      <p>
        I'm a Full Stack Developer and AI/ML Enthusiast with a passion for building scalable,
        intelligent, and responsive web applications. I specialize in MERN stack development —
        MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js — and also explore the integration of
        Machine Learning models into web solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Prof. Ramkrishna More College and have completed
        internships where I contributed to full-stack and AI-powered projects using React, Redux,
        RESTful APIs, and Python-based ML frameworks.
